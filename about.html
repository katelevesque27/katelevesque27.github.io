            <h4>Top Beaches & Spots in Orleans, Cape Cod</h4>
            <p> Located on the mid-to-outer arm, Orleans offers a perfect combination of local culture, 
                outdoor activities, and in my opinion, the best beaches. Whether you're looking for calm 
                walks along the shore, having a more active family-friendly beach, or more lowkey sunset trips, 
                Orleans is the place to be as it offers all of this and more with its beaches. Nauset Beach is 
                the perfect spot for those looking to see the Cape’s coastline and have a classic beach day. 
                When visiting, you can expect to see people surfing, fishing, and swimming in the water, even 
                though it’s cold. Skaket Beach offers a completely different environment with shallow waters 
                and small waves. This beach is perfect for families with young kids or anyone seeking a more 
                laid-back beach day and warmer water. Located on the bay side of Orleans, the beach is perfect 
                for paddleboarding, skimboarding, or walking at low tide on the sandbars. Last but not least is 
                Rock Harbor, which is a quiet and small harbor with a beach. It is an ideal spot for sunsets. 
                The harbor’s location along the water provides a great community of visitors looking to watch 
                the sunset. It can get buggy, so go in August. Overall, Orleans offers a beach for every type of 
                person and these are my best beach recommendations! </p>
